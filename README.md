# Tensorflow-image-labeler-for-Pontiac-Fieros.-
This project focuses on retraining the tensorflow for poets from Google's codelab and then implementing it inside an Android app. The app will take in an image of a Pontiac Fiero and then display the year and trim level of that Fiero. The training data does not have every single trim level of the Fiero, but it has a majority of them.
